# What does this mod do?
The aim of this mod is to reduce the amount of work that users of mods or modpack makers have to do in form of porting usable product recipes (Any recipe that is not just used as a crafting component, for example iron dust would not count.) from other mods into different mods' machines, allowing the user to choose what method of automation they would like to go down. The recipes added would also make sense in the real world, for example, this mod would allow Create's mixer to produce Farmer's Delight's drinks, but that doesn't even scratch the surface.

## How do I request a recipe to added?
First check if your recipe includes any potentially duplicate item between mods. (Any item that two or more mods each have their own copy of the item; typically a metal crafting material.) If this is true, then look no further than the mod **[All the Compatibility](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/all-the-compatibility)**, which standardizes all the recipes involving said materials. Also keep in mind that I will not port recipes to other mods workbenches (e.g. Farmer's Delight's cooking pot.), I will only port to machines that can be automated. (e.g. Create's mixer.)
With that out of the way, you can submit your recipe as a GitHub issue to **[here](https://github.com/QuantumZizo/CrossRecipes/issues)**, with the label of "Enhancement".
