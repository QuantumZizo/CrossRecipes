# What does this mod do?
The aim of this mod is to reduce the amount of work that users of mods or modpack makers have to do in form of porting usable product recipes (Any recipe that is not just used as a crafting component, for example iron dust would not count.) from other mod's into different mod's machines, allowing the user to choose what method of crafting/automation they would like to go down. The recipes added would also make sense in the real work, for example, this mod would allow Create's spout to fill bottles with milk to create Farmer's Delight milk bottles, but that doesn't even scratch the surface.

## How do I request a recipe to added?
First check if your recipe includes any potentially duplicate item between mods. (Any item that two or more mods each have their own copy of the item; typically a metal crafting material.) If this is true, then look no further than the mod **[All the Compatibility](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/all-the-compatibility)**, which standardizes all the recipes involving said materials.
With that out of the way, you can submit your recipe as a GitHub issue to **[here](https://github.com/QuantumZizo/CrossRecipes/issues)**, with the label of "Enhancement".
